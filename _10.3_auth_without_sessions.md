# Dummy Authentication (without sessions)

What API should we implement for authentication flow?
- `POST /api/user`: We already have it to register users by `email+password`
- `POST /api/login`: Of course, we need login user by `email+password` after they have registered
  - When login is done, browser must remember that login is done. Let's return `user_id` [cookie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) in the response
- `POST /api/logout`: Having login means having logout
  - We want browser to forget about user. Let's just clear `user_id` cookie
- `POST /api/auth`: Each time I return to website I should still stay logged in without submitting `email+password` form each time
  - Browser knows only `user_id` cookie - we don't store `email` in browser, and definitely we don't store `password`. So our endpoint checks `user_id` cookie, and if it's valid returns `email` (which represent User Profile)

Any other endpoint which we want to be protected by auth should also check if `user_id` cookie is sent in request (meaning user is logged in, and we know who exactly) or not.

## Implementation

1) Check `main.py` - all endpoints are implemented there.
2) Testing:
```shell
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/login -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user100@example.com", "password": "qwerty"}'
# 404 {"detail":"No such email registered"}
```

```shell
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/login -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user1@example.com", "password": "asdfg"}'
# 401 {"detail":"Invalid password"}
```

```shell
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/login -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user1@example.com", "password": "qwerty"}'
200 {"email":"user1@example.com"}
# set-cookie: user_id=67f0e209d701617a28e6bb83;
```

```shell
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/logout -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"
# 200 {"status":"Ok"}
```

```shell
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -b "user_id=67f0e209d701617a28e6bb83"
# 200 {"email":"user1@example.com"}
```

## Why this is a dummy approach?
If someone knows your `user_id`, they will get a full access to your profile forever - just send `user_id` in all the requests and that's it. Not to mention that `user_id` is usually not so random, thus easier to steal...

That's why we need a more random identifier a) that doesn't live forever b) that we fully control on our side

**Session**. See next step.
