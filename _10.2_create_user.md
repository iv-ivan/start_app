# API to sign up new users
When new user is registered, they provide email and password.

We should safely remember them.

## Safety
It's safe to pass password in **https** request POST body, but it's not safe to store passwords in database - they need to be encrypted.

The standard approach is to store hashes of passwords: hash function converts `password_string->hash` very fast, but backward conversion `hash->password_string` is computationally complex.

Although, just storing `hash(password)` is still not safe. Same passwords give same hash, which makes it vulnerable to statistical analysis. That's why [salting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) is used:
- Randomly generate salt for each sign up request: `salt=random_string`
- Store in DB a pair: `hash(password_concat_salt), salt;`

## Steps
1) We will use `bcrypt` library for password hashing.
```requirements
# requirements.txt
...
bcrypt>=4.3.0,<4.4.0
```
2) New code is added to `async def create_user` in `main.py`. It does exactly the same as described above.
3) Test it `MONGO_CONNECTION=<str> python3 -m fastapi dev main.py`:
```shell
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/user -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "qwerty"}'
```
- If request repeated, you will get 409 Conflict
- If password/user is missing in Data, you will get 422 Unprocessable Content

4) You can see that the user was created in MongoAtlas UI:
