# start_app

I've created this repository to answer the question: 

> **How to launch a production-ready application in the least possible amount of time?**

## Result
The answer contains ***9 steps*** and ***700 lines*** of code.

The resulting app contains:
1) Backend API ‚Äì Python, [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
2) Single Page Application (SPA) frontend ‚Äì Typescript, [React](https://react.dev/)
3) Cloud infrastructure to host backend/frontend ‚Äì [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
4) Mobile app for Android + iOS ‚Äì [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
5) CI/CD ‚Äì [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
6) **TODO**: Session Based Authentication


This is a MVP (Minimal Viable Product) with all the essential parts like CI, IaC, backend/frontend/mobile etc. You can build anything starting from this template.

## HowTo

The `main` branch contains 9 commits, 1 per step. 

Each commit is self-sufficient - you can read instructions in corresponding `.md` file, check the diff, check file state, and run it.

üöÄ Just switch to the 1st commit, and start! üöÄ

_Then you're finished the 1st step, switch to the 2nd commit, then 3rd, 4th etc..._

**_Note:_** If you have any questions throughout the process ask ChatGPT for help. 
I don't cover all the details about all the concepts, I only provide high-level comments + links to documentation.

## Use cases


This repository might be useful for:
