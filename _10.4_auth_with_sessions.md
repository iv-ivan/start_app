# Session Based Auth
1) We use `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` to generate secure URL-safe token. `32` represents it's complexity.
2) We store `user_id->session_id` in database with specified expire time
   - If session is found in this collection, we can retrieve corresponding `user_id` and user from `Users` collection
   - If session is not in the collection, it means it's invalid or expired, and user & request with such credentials is not authenticated
3) Sessions don't live forever, all accounts will be logged out after **1 year**. it's safer.
   - Also, in case user account is stole we can delete all sessions quickly to logout every session
3) Everything else stays very similar to prev step. **_In general, we've just replaced_** `user_id` with `session_id`
4) Testing:
```shell
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/login -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user1@example.com", "password": "qwerty"}'
# 200 {"email":"user1@example.com"}
# set-cookie: session_id=<session_id>;
```

```shell
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -b "session_id=<session_id>"
# 200 {"email":"user1@example.com"}
```

```shell
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -b "session_id=123456"
# 401 {"detail":"Invalid session"}
```

```shell
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/logout -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"
# 401 {"detail":"Not authenticated"}
```

```shell
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/logout -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -b "session_id=<session_id>"
# 200 {"status":"Ok"}
# set-cookie: session_id="";

# When repeated for the same user:
# 404 {"detail":"Session is already expired"}
# set-cookie: session_id="";
```
