# Connecting to MongoDB
To store users and sessions for our app, we need a database. I choose Mongo because it has free tier:
https://www.mongodb.com/lp/cloud/atlas/try4-reg

1) Save mongo **password** - we will need it later!

2) Patch: `backend/requirements.txt`
```requirements
...
motor[srv]>=3.7.0,<3.8.0
```

3) Install mongodb locally for CLI tools etc. [[docs]](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
```shell
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew update
brew install mongodb-community@8.0
```

4) After that we should allow IPs which can conenct to Mongo. In Mongo Atlas go to `Security->Network Access->Edit` and select `Allow Access From Anywhere`. _Note:_ In real production better don't do this and limit IPs properly by `AWS Peering`, or by choosing AWS-hosted DB.

5) Let's create `users` and `sessions` collections next!
   - Copy `Database->Clusters->Connect->Connection string` from Atlas UI
   - Run  `MONGO_CONNECTION="YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING" create_collections.py`

6) Our cloud service will also connect to Mongo. But `connection_string` contains password and must be stored securely.
   - Go to [AWS Secrets Manager](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/listsecrets?region=eu-west-1), and in `eu-west-1` region add new secret as `Other type->Plain text` with name `mongo_connection`
7) Let's test `main.py`. I've added a code to setup and close DB connection
```shell
MONGO_CONNECTION="YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING" python3 -m fastapi dev main.py
```
```text
# Logs
...
Connect to Mongo...
Collections ['sessions', 'users']

# After "Ctrl + C" you will see: 
Close Mongo connection...
...
```
If connection can't be established, you will see:
```text
...
Application startup failed. Exiting.
```
8) If you want to launch Docker, provide env var:
```shell
docker run -d -e MONGO_CONNECTION="connection_string" --name mycontainer -p 80:80 myimage
```

9) **Now remember** to provide env var when launching service locally: `MONGO_CONNECTION="connection_string" python3 -m fastapi dev main.py`
